# Walter's Portfolio - Built with React

Welcome to my portfolio project! This application showcases my work and skills, built using React and modern web development practices.

## Project Overview

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). It includes a JSON server for managing data and demonstrates a fully functional React-based application.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, clone the repository and install the dependencies using `npm install`.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run the following commands:

### `npm start`

Starts the app in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The app supports hot-reloading, so changes will reflect immediately.\
Check the console for any linting errors.

### `npm test`

Runs the test suite in interactive watch mode.\
For more details, refer to the [running tests documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests).

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production in the `build` folder.\
The production build is optimized for performance, with minified files and hashed filenames.

For deployment instructions, see the [deployment documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment).

### `npm run server`

Starts the JSON server to serve data from the `data` folder.\
This is used to simulate a backend for the portfolio application.

## Features

- Interactive and responsive design
